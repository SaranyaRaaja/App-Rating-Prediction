# App-Rating-Prediction
Application rating prediction project uses a data set which holds various information such as ratings,app names,size, cost and so on. This project starts with data cleansing, data wrangling and data analyzing using python. I used basic and simple functions to analyze the dataset.

Problem Statement: 
I have a dataset containing features of apps present in google playstore, preparing a model to predt the rating.

Technologies Used: 
Python Jupiter Notebook Libraries: numpy pandas For visualization: seaborn matplot For Scaling and processing: min-max scaler For Classification and Prediction: Scikit learn: knn

#Work done: Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)

#Output: Rating predicted with the model along with visualization.
